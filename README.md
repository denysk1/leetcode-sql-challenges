Welcome to my **LeetCode SQL Challenges** repository! Here, you'll find solutions to SQL problems ranging from **Easy** to **Hard**, categorized by difficulty for better navigation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:
- **Easy**: Beginner-friendly problems to build fundamental SQL skills.
- **Medium**: Intermediate challenges to deepen your understanding of SQL concepts.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems to push the limits of your SQL expertise.

Each folder contains a `.sql` file for each challenge a detailed description of the problem and its requirements as comments in the file, at the very end of the file you'll find the solution.
