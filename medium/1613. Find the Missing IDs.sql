/*
Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
 

Write a solution to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+
Output: 
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Explanation: 
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.

-- Solution:
with recursive cte as (
    select 1 as expected_customer_id
    union all
    select expected_customer_id + 1
    from cte
    where expected_customer_id < (select max(customer_id) from Customers)
)
select
    expected_customer_id as ids
from Customers c
right join cte on cte.expected_customer_id = c.customer_id 
where c.customer_id is null;
