id is an auto-increment primary key (column with unique values).
candidateId is a foreign key (reference column) to id from the Candidate table.
Each row of this table determines the candidate who got the ith vote in the elections.
 

Write a solution to report the name of the winning candidate (i.e., the candidate who got the largest number of votes).

The test cases are generated so that exactly one candidate wins the elections.

The result format is in the following example.
